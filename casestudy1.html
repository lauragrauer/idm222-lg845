            OVERVIEW</h4><p>

        This project focused on exploring the principles, patterns, and methods of interaction design. In my search for an app that could benefit
         from a fresh approach, I selected the widely used task management tool, Todoist. Known for effectively organizing tasks, setting deadlines, 
         and structuring projects into manageable sections, Todoist was an ideal candidate for enhancement.
    <br><br>
    In this rebranding, I aimed to improve Todoist’s usability and user engagement by emphasizing simplicity and feedback. After analyzing the app’s 
    current navigation patterns, input controls, and onboarding flows, I identified several elements with room for improvement. As a result, I implemented 
    a rebranding of the micro-interactions and overall interface to reduce cognitive load and create a more seamless, user-friendly experience.</p>

        TODOIST</h3><h4>

        GENERAL USERS & USABILITY ANALYSIS</h4><p>

        While Todoist is a highly popular task management app, it’s primarily designed with detail-oriented users in mind, such as those in corporate or 
        academic settings. Its interface includes a wide range of advanced features, but this can sometimes feel overbearing for some users.</p></div><hr>

<!-- TASK AND APPFLOW SECTION -->
<body><br><br>

        TASK & APPFLOW</h4><p>

        The original app’s task flow is functional, but there is potential for a more streamlined approach to text usage and button layout
        that simplifies the process of creating and removing tasks.

<br><br>
        The number of buttons and options may lead to cognitive overload for users seeking a quick and straightforward experience. While 
        triggers and interactions within this certain task are cohesive, some premium features require in-app purchases to unlock without 
        prior indication.
        This could create uncertainty for users who may expect complete functionality upon installation. Providing clearer access to 
        premium features or indicating in-app purchases would enhance the transparency of the app’s functionality and pricing structure.

<br><hr><p>
        The same can go for the app flow as well. There are a large number of triggers needed to provide the 
        following feedback, and they fall into the numerous menus displayed in the home location.
        Users will have to spend time learning and familiarizing themselves with the location of each function.</p>




<!-- WIREFRAMING -->

    <img src="./images/todo-sketch3.png" width="500" height="500" alt="wiresketch3""><br><h4>
        WIREFRAMES & WIREFLOW</h4><p>

        The initial creation of wireframes was needed to establish a clear foundation for the rebrand.

        To make the app more accessible to a broader user base not accustomed to cognitively demanding interfaces, a simplified 
        layout and format were essential. This restructuring aimed to minimize mental load, allowing users of varying backgrounds to 
        navigate tasks quickly.

<hr><div class="custom-content-box"><p>

        To do so, I've created buttons with larger padding to enhance touch accuracy and ensure easy usability across different 
        devices.This also contributes to a clean, uncluttered design that highlights key actions without an overwhelming feeling. 
        change of task bar locations, as well as a simplification, was also implemented to reduce the cognitive load a user may experience.
        As for the wire flow displayed, a simplification of feedback was constructed to offer a more efficient action and feedback method.

<br><br>
        Symbols were also implemented to give the user a better understanding of their action, as well as an undo button for 
        incorrect action taken by the user.

<!-- REBRANDING -->

<img src="./images/todo-rebranding.png" width="500" height="500" alt="appflow""><br><h3>

        RECONSTRUCTION</h3><h4>
        DESIGN PROCESS</h4><p>

        With a recreation of this app, I believed some areas held value. An example would be the well saturated colors the previous
        program used in contrast to the monochrome background. This idea made way into the rebranding. The primary color was switched to
        green though, as this specific color typically has a more positive association when comparison to red.

<br><br>
        To further accentuate divisions, I felt it was best to add more colors than previously, as well as simplification of text
        to make it more convenient to the average individual. By incorporating the larger range of color options, users will be able to
        associate a specific color with their subject and have an easier time finding their specific tasks.

<br><br>
        A change of the logo was also needed to correlate with the new color palette into this rebrand. To correspond with the 
        idea of the common, organic to do list, I created a simple design of a note page. An additional clock icon was implemented as well
        to indicate the time limit associated with this list.</p></body></div>

        IXFLOW</h4><p><b>
        STARTING THE SEARCH - </b> The returning user journey begins with a search action. The search bar
        is positioned at the top of the mobile interface for clear affordance. This design choice helps the user quickly 
        locate the search feature. A "0 Results" screen will appear if the text typed is unavailable. If the correct phrasing
        is typed, 1 or more tasks will appear as a clickable option.

<br><br><b>
        SELECTING A TASK - </b>When the user’s search results display, they tap the specific item they need. 
        This action triggers a description box, which appears with a color-coordinated background to enhance focus. The background
        partially hides, and the chosen color fills the screen, creating a cohesive visual effect.
        
<br><br><b>
        NAVIGATION - </b>The user can easily return to the previous page tapping the arrow button in the top left. 
        Additionally, by selecting the “Inbox” or “Today” options, the user can access their task list.
        
<br><br><b>
        COMPLETING A TASK -</b> To mark a task as complete, the user taps the circle next to the task title. This
        triggers a checkmark icon and a confirmation modal that provides immediate feedback, asking if the task 
        is confirmed as completed. Once confirmed, the task fades in transparency, shifts to the completed page, and the
        other tasks adjust their positions, offering further feedback on the action. If accidently tapped, the user can 
        choose the X icon and the position of the task will remain the same. This is a universal option for this menu.
        
<br><br><b>
        DELETING A COMPLETED TASK -</b> If the user wants to fully delete a completed task, they navigate to the completed 
        section. By clicking the X icon located in the left of the task description, they trigger a minimized animation of 
        the task moving to the trash icon, indicating complete deletion.
        
<br><br><b>
        MANAGING SUBJECT GROUPS -</b> Subject groups can be managed on the homepage. Using the “Remove Subject” option 
        allows the user to delete a group, with adjacent groups filling in any empty space left behind. With this option 
        clicked, an X icon will appear closely for all of the subjects. The user may choose which subject they would like 
        to remove.
        
<br><br><b>
        ADDING A NEW SUBJECT -</b> The “Add Subject” button, located above the “Remove Subject” button, opens a menu where
            the user can customize the subject’s title, description, and color. The rule of colors is that there are six color
            options; upon choosing a color, the background updates immediately, giving visual feedback on their selection.
        
<br><br><b>
        ORGANIZING TASKS BY SUBJECT -</b> By clicking any subject, the user opens its dedicated folder, where tasks specific
        to that subject are organized separately. Here, the user can add a task with fields for the title, description, date,
        and time. If they accidentally add the task to the wrong subject, they can use an option to transfer the task to another
        subject’s folder.</div></p></div>

        FINAL ANIMATION
        
</h4><p>
        Using Figma, Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator, I developed the final animation for the rebranded app.

<br><br>
        This version showcases a to-do list that removes unnecessary elements, incorporates a more contrasting 
        color palette, and enhances micro interactions to create a more engaging user experience.

<br><br>
        Overall, the rebranding results in a simplified to-do list that prioritizes clarity and usability. 
        This also caters more to users who prefer a more simplistic task management app while still giving 
        certain specific task options implemented into the design.
