               <h4>BACKGROUND AND REASONING</h4>
               <p>Street Tails Animal Rescue, located in an upscale area of Philadelphia, stands apart from other dog adoption services with its unique 
                   
                approach to finding adoptable pets. Rather than capturing stray dogs from public areas, this shelter rescues dogs that have been waiting for adoption for a considerable amount of time.

               <br><br>Unlike other similar organizations providing essential services, their primary mission is to provide emotional companionship through their customer's willingness to obtain a 
                
                furry companion. Given the city-like demographic in Philadelphia, there is a lower demand for service dogs, which is a need Street Tails does not focus on. Instead, their efforts are dedicated 
                   
                to nurturing the bond between humans and their new family members, enriching lives through the joy of pet ownership.
                   
               <br><br>Having personally volunteered with Street Tail's dog walking program, I firsthand experienced the organization's commitment to each pet's well being and welcoming nature of the staff. 
                
                This experience influenced my redesign, aiming to create a site that reflects their warmth and commitment with features that make browsing and adopting pets a joyful, straightforward experience.</p>

        <h3>STREET TAILS</h3>
        <h4>GENERAL USERS & USABILITY ANALYSIS</h4>
        <p>The shelterâ€™s primary audience includes potential adopters, especially those looking for unique rescue experiences.

       <br><br>Many visitors are local and come from nearby areas like Northern Liberties, where higher living costs often align with 
        higher income levels.
            
        <br><br> This demographic also includes potential donors, volunteers for dog-walking programs, pet owners, and foster providers, all contributing to a supportive community around the shelter.</p></div>
        <hr>
        <div class="custom-content-box">
        <p>When coming into usability, The Street Tails website has an ample color palette to maintain a rather clean, yet homely atmosphere. All of the information is condensed in the middle; with this fact, information should be easier to read.

        <br><br>However, there seems to be a lack of words in the original website. The important information provided is located in another website and focuses on their basic demographics.
            
        <br><br>There is no given back story for these animals, so there is a lack of vital emotional contribution. Furthermore, the majority of the home page is a duplicate taskbar, and the upcoming events are listed in an unconventional location.
            
        <br><br>This may give the user the wrong impression on their importance. Although the larger padding is a plus, the navigation may leave many users  confused due to the amount of subcategories listed in the bar.</p></div>




<!-- DESIGN GOALS -->  
    <br>
    <h4>DESIGN GOALS</h4>

    <p>
    The goal of this redesign is to not only create a cleaner interface, but to maintain the homely atmosphere and further the emotional value of the pages. This is imperative for users because that would be the main contributing factor towards their reason for viewing the website.

    <br><br>
    I also want to further the usability so the user will be able to efficiently navigate the website with ease, and to have them quickly find important information such as adoption procedures, available dogs, donation options, or volunteer opportunities. Not only that, but having a responsive design in multiple platforms will decrease the chance of the individual to struggle with finding their goals or complex navigation.</p>




<!-- WIREFRAMING -->
<div class="custom-content-box">
<body><br><br>
    <img src="./images/ss-desktopwire.png" width="500" height="500" alt="appflow"">
    <h3>DESKTOP</h3>
    <img src="./images/ss-mobilewire.png" width="500" height="500" alt="wiresketch""> 
    <h3>MOBILE</h3>
    <img src="./images/ss-tabletwire.png" width="500" height="500" alt="wiresketch2""> 
    <h3>TABLET</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>WIREFRAMES</h4>
    <p>
        Because users may be accessing the platform on multiple platforms, it is duly noted to take the most used ones into consideration: desktop, 
        tablet, mobile.

        <br><br>Each of these devices has a distinct visual dimension, so the general layout, spacing, and proportions must be tailored accordingly to optimize 
        both the usability and cohesive nature of all platforms.
        
        <br><br>While the padding aligned well in the original website, a mobile version will be adjusted due to its spacing adjustment requirements. To 
        create a 
        seamless design, I focused to balance consistency with flexibility across the platforms.
        
        <br><br>My approach was to establish a set of core elements for each device and to adjust the spacing as needed.
        
        <br><br>The warm, homely theme still needed to remain consistent as well due to it being one of largest reasons for a user to take notice of this 
        website;
        it also has the possibility to have the user feel at ease while navigating the platform. As a result, I felt as if consistently keeping the
        majority of background containers with rounded edges would create a much softer approach.
        </div></p></div>




<!-- ATOMIC DESIGN -->
<body><br>
    <img src="./images/ss-style1.png" width="500" height="500" alt="appflow"">    
    <br>
    <h4>ATOMIC DESIGN</h4>
    <h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
    <p>
    Through the original website, certain pages would alter their fonts when compared to the original home page.  A sudden shift in typography
     can disrupt the flow of the user experience, making it harder for visitors to navigate and engage with the content.

    <br><br>
    It is important to remain consistent for quicker readability and a simplistic font. To maintain the softer appearance, a softer font 
    would also needed to be incorporated. Josefin Sans was chosen because it meets all of these requirements, offering both clarity and a gentle 
    aesthetic.

    
    <hr><br>
    <img src="./images/ss-style2.png" width="500" height="500" alt="appflow"">    
    <br>
    <h3>COLOR PALETTE</h3>
    <p>
    The previous color palette was very homely and effectively conveyed an emotional connection with users. However, many areas of the website seemed 
    to blend too much with other sections, leading to a lack of visual distinction and emphasis. To improve user experience, it's important to introduce 
    higher contrast in both values and colors.

    <br><br>
    For an inviting color palette, I had decided implement a larger range of hues. Red-based colors were used to represent the adoptable dogs, while
    blue-based colors were primarily associated with information. In cases where more contrast was needed, these colors would subtly shift to ensure 
    better visual differentiation. To make the donation section more engaging, I incorporated a wider variety of colors, giving it a more vibrant and fun appearance; this would make this particular section more encouraging for user and motivating to contribute to the organization.

    
    <hr><br>
    <img src="./images/ss-style3.png" width="500" height="500" alt="appflow"">    
    <br>
    <h3>THEME CHOICES</h3>
    <p>
    Incorporating simple graphics into the design would enhance the website's appeal and encourage users to stay engaged. To achieve this, 
    I created and implemented dog-related interactive to add a playful, dynamic tough.

    <br><br>
    These elements add a sense of fun and lightheartedness, making the browsing experience enjoyable and encouraging users to spend more
    time exploring the site.




<!-- MICROINTERACTION INPUT -->

        <img src="./images/ss-desktopmicroint.png" width="500" height="500" alt="appflow"">
        <br>
        <h4>MICRO INTERACTION INPUT</h4>
        <p>Both organic and modern animations will be showcased in the micro-interactions. By blending these styles together, I aimed for users to remain aware they were interacting with technology while appreciating the homely appearance. This combination creates a seamless user experience that correlates with the emotional decision to adopt one of their dogs and to explore more of their content.

        <br><br>
        A sense of joy and familiarity may occur, making the digital experience seem much more personal and less transactional. A steady use of micro-interactions across devices is essential to create an intuitive experience that reduces the cognitive load on users as they switch between tools.
            
        <br><br>
        By maintaining consistent interaction patterns, animations, and visual feedback, users can rely on familiar cues, to enhance their comfort and efficiency. This also helps build muscle memory, enabling users to anticipate actions and outcomes without needing to relearn interfaces. This can also guide users through tasks, reinforce brand identity, and improve overall engagement, creating a more delightful and user-friendly experience.

<!-- CROSS DEVICE LAYOUT -->

        <h3>DESKTOP</h3>

        <h3>TABLET</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>CROSS-DEVICE LAYOUT</h4>
        <p>
        For the final layout, I focused on maintaining consistent color, images, text, and micro-interactions across devices. The unique layout characteristics of each device were carefully considered.

        <br><br>On the desktop, I took advantage of the larger screen size to offer a more interactive experience. For the mobile version, I repositioned the taskbar to the bottom and incorporated a scrollable animation to give it a more app-like feel.
            
        <br><br>To avoid cognitive overload, I simplified certain elements and increased text size for better readability on the smaller screen. The tablet layout strikes a balance between the two, accommodating features from both the desktop and mobile versions.
            
        <br><br>Its screen size allows for a taskbar similar to the desktop, while tap or scroll actions trigger micro animations akin to those on mobile, as tablets typically lack clickable interfaces.
            
        <br><br>Having similar elements for certain areas was key for the user to navigate the website efficiently, as well as maintaining the emotionally positive theme that correlates to the reasoning.

    <h4>FINAL ANIMATION AND HEURISTICS
    </h4>
    <p>Using Figma, Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator, I developed the final animation for the rebranded app.
    <br><br>
            This version showcases a to-do list that removes unnecessary elements, incorporates a more contrasting 
            color palette, and enhances micro interactions to create a more engaging user experience.
    <br><br>
            Overall, the rebranding results in a simplified to-do list that prioritizes clarity and usability. 
            This also caters more to users who prefer a more simplistic task management app while still giving 
            certain specific task options implemented into the design.</p></div></body>
