        BACKGROUND SUMMARY & GENERAL USERS</h4><p>

        This case study focuses on the wireframing redesign of the Yale School of Art’s website with the primary goal focusing on the enhancement of user experience through a more intuitive yet visually appealing interface. The redesign aims to prioritize accessibility, correcting feedback input and enhancing constraints to create a stronger connection between institution and community.

<br><br>
        The website is accessible to the public eye. However there is also a unique feature not many other know.
                    
<br><br>
        The Yale School of Art website can be edited by any student who currently goes to the school, whether it be the images in the background or text displayed in the primary sections. As a result, the website primarily caters to the student demographic, providing them with the latest news and updates about events and activities.</p>

YALE</h3><h4>

        YALE SCHOOL OF ART BUTTOM PLACEMENT ANALYSIS AND REMAPPING</h4><p>

        The Yale School of Art website is well-known for its unique student editing feature, yet it often faces criticism due to 
        its complex and confusing navigation.

<br><br>
        This current wireframe showcases an overwhelmingly neon color palette, which can be visually distracting for many users.
            
<br><br>
        While it's admirable that students can modify the site's images and text colors, this flexibility has its drawbacks. Despite 
        the ability to change visual elements, the layout remains consistent and buttons and content is fixed.
            
<br><br>
        Even prior to the image cogitative overload provided by the students, this specific layout are challenging for users trying to 
        locate key resources due to its cramp sectioning.</p></div>



 <!-- CHANGE 1 NAVIGATION BAR -->
<body><br><br>
<img src="./images/yale-nav2.png" width="150" height="150" alt="yalenavigation"">
<h3>BEFORE</h3>
<img src="./images/yale-navrework.png" width="400" height="400" alt="navigationredesignyale""><h3>

        AFTER</h3><br><h4>

        CHANGE 1. NAVIGATION BAR</h4><p>

        A notable issue with the original wireframe is the placement of the site navigation bar. Due to this irregular placement, 
        there is a
        decreased accessibility for novice users.

<br><br>
        This placement can be achieved correctly, however the buttons are also close together, further promoting a visual clutter. 
        Both factors increase the learning curve and cognitive load for users, leading to reduced efficiency and longer times to find their goals.
        
<hr><p>
        Relocating the navigation bar to a familiar position enhances discoverability, making it easier for users to find their 
        goals; this change also improves spatial arrangement by reducing the clutter of the close buttons.
        
<br><br>
        By visually separating the button with a distinct background box, there is a greater contrast against surrounding elements. 
        Additionally, while some pages had a scrolling menu, this new concept features a static navigation bar that remains consistent 
        across all pages, promoting a seamless user experience.</p>




<!--CHANGE 2. BUTTON FEEDBACK -->
<div class="custom-content-box">
<body><br><br>
<img src="./images/yale-gif1.gif" width="500" height="500" alt="appflow""><h3>

        BEFORE</h3>

<img src="./images/yale-gif2.gif" width="500" height="500" alt="wiresketch""><h3>

        AFTER

</h3><br><h4>
        CHANGE 2. BUTTON FEEDBACK</h4><p>
        
        The second issue is the lack of consistent button feedback. Currently, feedback is limited to the menu bar with blue outlined indicators for 
        links, while many other buttons lack visual cues to differentiate them from static text.

<br><br>
        Without micro-interactions to indicate actions, users may feel uncertain about whether their inputs will produce the desired 
        results, making the interface seem unresponsive. Such details can significantly impact the website's overall effectiveness, as users tend to prefer a 
        responsive design.

<hr><div class="custom-content-box"><p>

        The solution is to implement clear, distinguishable feedback for button interactions. This will allow users to easily identify 
        buttons through hover effects and subtle design changes, enhancing clarity and usability.

<br><br>
        By incorporating micro-interactions, such as color transitions and simple animations, buttons become more recognizable and 
        intuitive. These small but impactful adjustments ensure that users can confidently locate and engage with interactive elements, significantly improving their 
        overall experience.
</div></p></div>




<!-- INCREASED CONSTRAINTS -->
<body><br>
<img src="./images/yale-navrework.png" width="500" height="500" alt="appflow"">
<h3>AFTER</h3>
<img src="./images/yale-nav1.png" width="200" height="200" alt="appflow""><h3>

        BEFORE

</h3><h4>
        CHANGE 3. INCREASED CONSTRAINTS

</h4><p>
        The next issue is the website’s insufficient constraints. While only Yale School of Art students can edit pages, the division 
        of editing by sections allows multiple users to modify the same page.

<br><br>
        This commendable initiative leads to inconsistencies and reduced usability, as visibility varies based on which student 
        edits a section, resulting in a lack of quality control.

<hr><p>
        The solution is to implement constraints across the entire application page. This allows students to contribute 
        creatively while ensuring consistency.

<br><br>
        Introducing an approval process enhances quality and visibility for non-affiliated users interested in the content. 
        It also lessens the risk of misinformation, as negative text and artwork can be removed before publication, despite student
        contributions.
        
<br><br>
        By visually separating the button with a distinct background box, there is a greater contrast against surrounding elements. 
        Additionally, while some pages had a scrolling menu, this new concept features a static navigation bar that remains consistent 
        across all pages, promoting a seamless user experience.</p>




<!-- CHANGE 4. MAPPING -->
<div class="custom-content-box"><body><br><br>
<img src="./images/yale-wire2.png" width="500" height="500" alt="appflow""><h3>

        BEFORE

</h3><img src="./images/yale-rework3.png" width="500" height="500" alt="wiresketch""><h3>

        AFTER

</h3><br><h4>
        CHANGE 4. MAPPING

</h4><p>
        The final alteration pertains to the website's mapping, which is poorly designed. It suffers from inconsistent element placement, 
        excessive right-side padding, and unclear control locations. These issues increase cognitive load and diminish user value.

<br><br>
        Disrupted information flow causes confusion and reduces engagement, while the excessive padding wastes screen space and contributes 
        to a disjointed layout. Additionally, unclear control placement hinders users' ability to understand interactions.
            
<br><br>
        As a resolution, I decided to enhance the natural mapping of the website. This approach reduces the need for users to rely on their 
        memory and lowers cognitive load, as the mapping will already be familiar to them.
        While users may still edit the page, consistent mapping will establish a clearer information hierarchy, making it easier for them to 
        discern important elements and navigate the site efficiently.

<!-- CONCLUSION FOR YALE-->
<img src="./images/yale-logo.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt="profile picture" style="border-left: 1.5px solid #5b5a5c;

<br><h4>
        CONCLUSION

</h4><p>
        Overall, the website is incredibly unique. Allowing students to contribute directly to the university they attend is a positive 
        concept that fosters a sense of ownership and engagement among these users.

<br><br>
        However, natural changes to the mapping, the creation of button feedback, and the establishment of constraints are necessary 
        to prioritize the users’ needs in web design. If there are potential users interested in the university, having both a creative and clean 
        website layout is essential for creating a positive impression.
